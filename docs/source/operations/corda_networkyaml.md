# Configuration file specification: R3 Corda
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file for setting up a Corda DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. Here is the structure of it.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass-Corda.png)

Before setting up a Corda DLT network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.
A sample configuration file is provide in the repo path:  
`platforms/r3-corda/configuration/samples/network-cordav2.yaml`  

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* frontend

* env

* docker

* orderers

* organizations

Here is the snapshot from the sample configuration file

![](./../_static/NetworkYamlCorda1.png)

The sections in the sample configuration file are  

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric, here in example its Corda

`version` defines the version of platform being used, here in example the Corda version is 4.0, the  corda version 4.1 is also supported and should be used.

`frontend` is a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not. Its value can only be enabled/disabled. This is only applicable if the sample Supplychain App is being installed.

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration. Value for proxy field under this section has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Corda.

The snapshot of the `env` section with example values is below
```yaml
  env:
    type: "env_type"                # tag for the environment. Important to run multiple flux on single cluster
    proxy: ambassador               # value has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Corda
    ambassadorPorts: 15010,15020    # Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here, must be comma-separated without spaces, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
    retry_count: 20                 # Retry count for the checks
    external_dns: enabled           # Should be enabled if using external-dns for automatic route configuration
```
The fields under `env` section are 

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'ambassador' only as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Corda |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here; must be comma-separated without spaces like `10010,10020`. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`     |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks.|
| external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |


`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.
(Note: Please use the [NMS Jenkins file](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/automation/r3-corda/NMS.Jenkinsfile) or/and [Doorman Jenkins file](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/automation/r3-corda/Doorman.Jenkinsfile) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks)

The snapshot of the `docker` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Docker registry details where images are stored. This will be used to create k8s secrets
  # Please ensure all required images are built and stored in this registry. 
  docker:
    url: "<url>"
    username: "<username>"
    password: "<password>"
```
The fields under `docker` section are

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| url        | Docker registry url                         | 
| username   | Username credential required for login      |
| password   | Password credential required for login      |

---
**NOTE:** Please follow [these instructions](../operations/configure_prerequisites.md#docker) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks.

The snapshot of the `orderers` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Remote connection information for doorman and networkmap (will be blank or removed for hosting organization)
  orderers:
    - orderer:
      type: doorman
      uri: https://doorman.test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com:8443
      certificate: home_dir/platforms/r3-corda/configuration/build/corda/doorman/tls/ambassador.crt
    - orderer:
      type: networkmap
      uri: https://networkmap.test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com:8443
      certificate: home_dir/platforms/r3-corda/configuration/build/corda/networkmap/tls/ambassador.crt
```
The `orderers` section contains a list of doorman/networkmap which is exposed to the network. Each `orderer` has the following fields:

| Field       | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| type        | For Corda, `networkmap` and `doorman` are the only valid type of orderers.    |
| uri         | Doorman/Networkmap external URL. This should be reachable from all nodes.     | 
| certificate | Directory path of public certificates for Doorman and Networkmap.             |


The `organizations` section allows specification of one or many organizations that will be connecting to a network. If an organization is also hosting the root of the network (e.g. doorman, membership service, etc), then these services should be listed in this section as well.
In the sample example the 1st Organisation is hosting the root of the network, so the services doorman, nms and notary are listed under the 1st organization's service.

The snapshot of an organization field with sample values is below
```yaml
    - organization:
      name: manufacturer
      country: CH

      type: node
      external_url_suffix: test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com
      cloud_provider: aws # Options: aws, azure, gcp
```
