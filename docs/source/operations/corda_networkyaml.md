# Configuration file specification: R3 Corda
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file for setting up a Corda DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. Here is the structure of it.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass.png)

Before setting up a Corda DLT network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.
The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* frontend

* env

* docker

* orderers

* organizations

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric.

`version` defines the version of platform being used.

`frontend` is a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not. Its value can only be enabled/disabled. This is only applicable if the sample Supplychain App is being installed.

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration.

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'ambassador' or 'haproxy' |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here; must be comma-separated without spaces like `10010,10020`. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`     |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks.|
| external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |


`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.
(Note: Please use the [NMS Jenkins file](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/automation/r3-corda/NMS.Jenkinsfile) or/and [Doorman Jenkins file](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/automation/r3-corda/Doorman.Jenkinsfile) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks)

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| url        | Docker registry url                         | 
| username   | Username credential required for login      |
| password   | Password credential required for login      |

---
**NOTE:** Please follow [these instructions](../operations/configure_prerequisites.md#docker) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks.

`orderers` section contains a list of doorman/networkmap which is exposed to the network.

| Field       | Description                                              |

| type        | For Corda, `networkmap` and `doorman` are the only valid type of orderers.   |

| certificate | Directory path of custom certificates for Doorman and Networkmap. |


`organizations` section contains the specifications of each organization.
