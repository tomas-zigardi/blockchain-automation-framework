# Configuration file specification: Hyperledger-Fabric
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file designed in the Blockchain Automation Framework for setting up a Fabric DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. Below shows its structure.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass.png)

Before setting up a Fabric DLT network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.
The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* docker

* frontend

* env

* orderers

* channels

* organizations

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric.

`version` defines the version of platform being used.

`frontend` is a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not. Its value can only be enabled/disabled. This is only applicable if the sample Supplychain App is being installed.

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration.

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'ambassador' or 'haproxy' |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here; must be comma-separated without spaces like `10010,10020`. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`     |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks.|
|external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |

`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.

| Field    | Description                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| url      | Docker registry url                    |
| username | Username credential required for login |
| password | Password credential required for login |

---
**NOTE:** Please follow [these instructions](../operations/configure_prerequisites.md#docker) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks.

`orderers` section contains a list of orderers with variables which will expose it for the network.

| org_name    | Name of the organization to which this orderer belong to |
| uri         | Orderer URL                                              |
