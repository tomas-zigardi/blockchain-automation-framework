# Configuration file specification: Hyperledger-Fabric
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file designed in the Blockchain Automation Framework for setting up a Fabric DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. Below shows its structure.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass-Fabric.png)

Before setting up a Fabric DLT network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.  
A sample configuration file is provided in the repo path:  
`platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples/network-fabricv2.yaml` 

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* docker

* frontend

* env

* orderers

* channels

* organizations

Here is the snapshot from the sample configuration file

![](./../_static/NetworkYamlFabric1.png)

The sections in the sample configuration file are  

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric, here in the example its Fabric

`version` defines the version of platform being used. The current Fabric version support is 1.4.0 and 1.4.4

`frontend` is a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not. Its value can only be enabled/disabled. This is only applicable if the sample Supplychain App is being installed.

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration. Vaule for proxy field under this section can be 'ambassador' or 'haproxy'

The snapshot of the `env` section with example value is below
```yaml 
  env:
    type: "env_type"              # tag for the environment. Important to run multiple flux on single cluster
    proxy: haproxy                  # values can be 'haproxy' or 'ambassador'
    ambassadorPorts: 15010,15020    # is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
    retry_count: 100                # Retry count for the checks
    external_dns: enabled           # Should be enabled if using external-dns for automatic route configuration
```
The fields under `env` section are 

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'haproxy' only as 'ambassador' has not been implemented for Fabric |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here; must be comma-separated without spaces like `10010,10020`. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`     |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks. |
|external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |

`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.

The snapshot of the `docker` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Docker registry details where images are stored. This will be used to create k8s secrets
  # Please ensure all required images are built and stored in this registry.
  # Do not check-in docker_password.
  docker:
    url: "docker_url"
    username: "docker_username"
    password: "docker_password"
```
The fields under `docker` section are

| Field    | Description                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| url      | Docker registry url                    |
| username | Username credential required for login |
| password | Password credential required for login |

---
**NOTE:** Please follow [these instructions](../operations/configure_prerequisites.md#docker) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks.

---

`orderers` section contains a list of orderers with variables which will expose it for the network.

The snapshot of the `orderers` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Remote connection information for orderer (will be blank or removed for orderer hosting organization)
  orderers:
    - orderer:
      type: orderer
      name: orderer1
      org_name: supplychain               #org_name should match one organization definition below in organizations: key            
      uri: orderer1.org1ambassador.blockchaincloudpoc.com:8443   # Can be external or internal URI for orderer which should be reachable by all peers
      certificate: /home/blockchain-automation-framework/build/orderer1.crt           # Ensure that the directory exists
    - orderer:
      type: orderer
      name: orderer2
      org_name: supplychain               #org_name should match one organization definition below in organizations: key            
      uri: orderer2.org1ambassador.blockchaincloudpoc.com:8443   # Can be external or internal URI for orderer which should be reachable by all peers

| name        | Name of the orderer service                                  |
| type        | For Fabric, `orderer` is the only valid type of orderers.   |
| org_name    | Name of the organization to which this orderer belong to |
| uri         | Orderer URL                                              |
| certificate | Path to orderer certificate. For inital network setup, ensure that the directory is present, the file need not be present. For adding a new organization, ensure that the file is the crt file of the orderer of the existing network. |

The organization with orderer type will have concensus service. The snapshot of consensus service with example values is below
```yaml
        consensus:
          name: kafka
          type: broker
          replicas: 4
          grpc:
            port: 9092
```
