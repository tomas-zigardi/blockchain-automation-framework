# Upgrading existing chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric

- [Pre-requisites](#pre_req)
- [Modifying configuration file](#create_config_file)
- [Running playbook to upgrade chaincode to new version in Hyperledger Fabric network](#run_network)

<a name = "pre_req"></a>
## Pre-requisites
Hyperledger Fabric network deployed, network.yaml configuration file already set and chaincode is installed and instantiated.

<a name = "create_config_file"></a>
## Modifying configuration file

The `network.yaml` file should contain the specific `network.organizations.services.peers.chaincode.arguments`, `network.organizations.services.peers.chaincode.version` and `network.organizations.services.peers.chaincode.name` variables which are used as arguments while upgrading the chaincode.

For reference, sample `network.yaml` file looks like:

```

# This is a sample configuration file for SupplyChain App which has 5 nodes.

  # Network level configuration specifies the attributes required for each organization
  # to join an existing network.

## Run playbook to upgrade the chaincode version in existing Hyperledger Fabric network

The playbook mentioned [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/chaincode-upgrade.yaml) is used to upgrade chaincode to a new version in the existing fabric network.
This can be done manually using the following command

```
    ansible-playbook platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/chaincode-upgrade.yaml --extra-vars "@path-to-network.yaml"
```
